This involves managing an Electronics Store model, offering a diverse range of electronic products such as air conditioners, refrigerators, televisions, washing machines, and dishwashers. 
I am tasked with designing and developing a comprehensive system to handle inventory management, including tracking incoming and outgoing products and updating product details with purchase and sales information.

In addition to inventory management, I am responsible for overseeing employee management. This includes maintaining records of their joining and exit dates, salary details, accrued leaves, and roles within the store. 
Furthermore, I need to establish a system to monitor employee performance, including incentives based on the number of products they sell to customers, in addition to their regular salary.

Overall, my objective is to create an efficient and organized system that facilitates smooth operations within the Electronics Store, ensuring accurate inventory management and effective employee tracking and incentive management.
